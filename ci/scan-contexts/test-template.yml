# Example AF fragment to show where extra jobs would slot if a team needs them.
# NOTE: Central reporting, user-agent, and global exclusions are managed by:
#   - ci/common/reporting.yml
#   - ci/common/user-agent.txt
#   - ci/common/global-exclusions.txt
# The task (ci/tasks/zap-af.yml) injects addOns/options/replacer/report/exitStatus for you.

# Teams typically only need to supply:
#   - urls.txt (required)
#   - config.yml (optional per-context SPA/API depth/duration thresholds)
#   - openapi.json (optional; if present for API contexts, we can add an OpenAPI job)

# If you later want OpenAPI per-context, add the job BEFORE spider/activeScan in a
# context-specific variant of the task, for example:
#
# jobs:
#   - type: openapi
#     parameters:
#       apiFile: "/zap/wrk/openapi.json"
#       targetUrl: "https://api.example.gov"
#
