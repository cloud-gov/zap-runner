# Security Compliance & NIST 800-53 Control Mapping

## Overview

This document maps the ZAP Runner security scanning platform capabilities to NIST 800-53 security controls, demonstrating compliance support for FedRAMP and FISMA requirements.

## NIST 800-53 Control Mappings

### Risk Assessment (RA)

#### RA-5: Vulnerability Scanning

**Control**: The organization scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications.

**Implementation**:

- ✅ Daily automated DAST scans across all contexts
- ✅ Multiple authentication methods for comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Parallel execution for efficiency
- ✅ DefectDojo integration for vulnerability tracking

**Evidence**:

- Scan schedule: Daily at 1 AM ET
- Coverage: 15+ URLs across 5 contexts
- Report formats: HTML, JSON, XML, SARIF

#### RA-5(1): Update Tool Capability

**Control**: The organization employs vulnerability scanning tools that include the capability to readily update the vulnerabilities to be scanned.

**Implementation**:

- ✅ ZAP stable version with regular updates
- ✅ Add-on management at build time
- ✅ Configurable scan policies and rules

#### RA-5(2): Update by Frequency

**Control**: The organization updates the vulnerability scanning tool capability frequently.

**Implementation**:

- ✅ Docker build supports version pinning
- ✅ `ENABLE_ADDON_UPDATE` build argument
- ✅ Automated pipeline for updates

### Continuous Monitoring (CA)

#### CA-2: Security Assessments

**Control**: The organization develops a security assessment plan and conducts security assessments.

**Implementation**:

- ✅ Automated security assessment via ZAP AF
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (42+ validation checks)
- ✅ Multiple scan contexts with different auth methods

#### CA-7: Continuous Monitoring

**Control**: The organization develops a continuous monitoring strategy and implements continuous monitoring.

**Implementation**:

- ✅ Daily automated scanning schedule
- ✅ Real-time vulnerability detection
- ✅ DefectDojo for trend analysis
- ✅ Slack alerting for critical findings

### System and Information Integrity (SI)

#### SI-2: Flaw Remediation

**Control**: The organization identifies, reports, and corrects information system flaws.

**Implementation**:

- ✅ Automated vulnerability identification via ZAP
- ✅ DefectDojo integration for tracking
- ✅ Risk-based reporting (High/Medium/Low)
- ✅ Per-hostname detailed reports

#### SI-3: Malicious Code Protection

**Control**: The organization employs malicious code protection mechanisms.

**Implementation**:

- ✅ Active scanning for security vulnerabilities
- ✅ XSS, SQL injection, and other attack detection
- ✅ Configurable alert thresholds

#### SI-4: Information System Monitoring

**Control**: The organization monitors the information system to detect attacks and indicators of potential attacks.

**Implementation**:

- ✅ Continuous DAST scanning
- ✅ Spider crawling for discovery
- ✅ Active attack simulation
- ✅ Alert generation for findings

### Configuration Management (CM)

#### CM-6: Configuration Settings

**Control**: The organization establishes and documents configuration settings for information technology products.

**Implementation**:

- ✅ Centralized configuration management
- ✅ Version-controlled settings
- ✅ Documented scan contexts and policies

#### CM-8: Information System Component Inventory

**Control**: The organization develops and documents an inventory of information system components.

**Implementation**:

- ✅ URL inventory per context
- ✅ API endpoint documentation
- ✅ Authentication method tracking

### Incident Response (IR)

#### IR-6: Incident Reporting

**Control**: The organization requires personnel to report suspected security incidents.

**Implementation**:

- ✅ Automated incident detection via scanning
- ✅ Slack webhook integration for alerts
- ✅ DefectDojo for incident tracking

## Compliance Features

### Authentication & Access Control

- **Multi-factor Support**: Via CF UAA and OpsUAA
- **Token Management**: Secure token handling
- **CredHub Integration**: Centralized secret management

### Audit & Accountability

- **Scan Logs**: Complete audit trail in Concourse
- **Report Archive**: Historical scan results
- **Change Tracking**: Git version control

### Data Protection

- **Encrypted Communication**: HTTPS for all scans
- **Secure Storage**: CredHub for credentials
- **Report Sanitization**: No secrets in outputs

## Compliance Metrics

| Metric                    | Target    | Current                     |
| ------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| Scan Frequency            | Daily     | ✅ Daily                    |
| Coverage                  | >90%      | ✅ 100% of defined contexts |
| Critical Finding Response | <24h      | ✅ Real-time alerts         |
| False Positive Rate       | <10%      | ✅ Confidence filtering     |
| Report Generation         | All scans | ✅ 100%                     |

## Compliance Reporting

### Executive Dashboard Metrics

1. **Vulnerability Trends**: Track findings over time
2. **Risk Distribution**: High/Medium/Low breakdown
3. **Coverage Metrics**: URLs and contexts scanned
4. **Response Times**: Time to detection and remediation

### Audit Evidence

- Scan execution logs (Concourse)
- Vulnerability reports (DefectDojo)
- Configuration changes (Git history)
- Authentication logs (CF/UAAC)
